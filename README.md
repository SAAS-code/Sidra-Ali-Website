# E-Learning Admin Dashboard

This project is a responsive Admin Dashboard interface for an E-learning platform. It allows admins to view key metrics such as registered users, courses, and system settings. The layout includes a sidebar for navigation and main content sections for dynamic data like course listings, user information, and settings forms.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Google Fonts (Poppins)
- Font Awesome Icons
- Figma (for layout inspiration)
- VS Code for development

## One Challenge or Insight
One challenge during development was refining the layout spacing and ensuring the color palette maintained accessibility and visual consistency. Aligning the sidebar with main content and giving the UI a clean, modern look required thoughtful adjustments to padding, grid, and color contrast.
